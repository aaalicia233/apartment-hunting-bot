## Find your next place faster

FindUrHome is a small tool that watches a list of supplied URLs for changes. When it sees a change, it will send an SMS to your phone with the changed URL, meaning you won't need to endlessly refresh pages ever again 😎


### Usage

To get started, you'll need to sign up for a [twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) (They offer a free trial that should accomodate the duration of your apartment hunt).

Once that's done, you'll need clone this repo

Finally, once your ENV's have been added, finish with the usual

```bash
$ yarn install // or npm install
$ yarn start
```

That's it - Happy apartment hunting 🕵!
